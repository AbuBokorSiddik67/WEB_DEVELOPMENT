    <p><i>I am going to Dhaka yesterday. There live in My uncle. He is a very good person.A lot of travel bloggers follow advice from other travel bloggers, which means they end up using the exact same Wordpress theme for their websites. When those travel blogs are also all pushing the same affiliate links (for Discover Cars, Viator, and other popular affiliates) the websites are pretty much indistinguishable from each other.

        This is one of the reasons I love Squarespace — it’s so much easier to build a customised website that is unique to you. 
        
        One more quick rant — most of the ‘best blog’ lists out there cover off the same travel blogs that have been kicking around the internet for a decade. There are so many more than the biggest travel blogs though (I’m thinking of websites like Nomadic Matt and A Blonde Abroad), and many newer sites have more elegant design.</i></p>
